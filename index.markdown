## Profile

I'm a social entrepreneur at all costs, a developer with a cause, and a fanatic about edible landscaping and sustainable living. I'm most passionate about social injustice issues, environmental issues, and health at the local and global levels.

With over a decade of experience developing web applications and a BS in Computer Science—I'm innovative, creative, self-motivated, and I know how to get things done. No task is too complicated for me, yet I know where to draw the line in terms of schedules, budgets, and resources.

## Education

University of Maryland University College, College Park, MD — BS in Computer Science, 2007

## Skills

I like to consider myself a complete stack. I've long built and managed my own servers in addition to designing, developing, and deploying my own applications. And while I'm a coder at heart, I've spent years not only coding but also designing the UIs to much of what I've coded, which most recently included 4Good.org and SoEpi.org, both of which (with exception to the 4Good logo) did not use a formal design phase or graphic designer.

### I'm totally cool with:

* Ruby, Rails, CoffeeScript/JavaScript, Sass/CSS, Haml/ERB/HTML
* JS, jQuery, Twitter's Bootstrap, Susy (grid calculations), responsive design

## Experience

### 4Good.org 2013-Present

4Good is a social network for nonprofit professionals and organizations to share and sell resources and to connect and to collaborate with each other. 4Good hosts three weekly nonprofit webinars on a mix of topics presented by thought-leaders in the nonprofit space, which always bring in crowds from one to three hundred attendees and sometimes much more (see our [Upcoming Nonprofit Webinars](https://4good.org/4good/upcoming-nonprofit-webinars) collection). 4Good was incubated in Good Done Great before it spun off in the summer of 2013. 4Good was initially led by myself, David Barach and Earl Bridges, but landed completely in my hands in July, 2014 when my parnters decided to focus soley on their other company, Good Done Great. Funding aside, 4Good has a bright future ahead of it with many new services and features. I built 4Good completely from scratch and continue to develop it on a daily basis.

I designed and developed the entire platform. After spending a year on the platform, we shut it down not long after launching as we had run out of resources. SoEpi may very well come back at some point in one shape or another. The code was open-sourced at https://github.com/jridgway/soepi.
