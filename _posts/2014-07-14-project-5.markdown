description: Grantr.com helps foundations and donors stay current on nonprofit organization's tax exempt statues. Users can add organizations to their watch-lists to receive reliable and timely email updates when their statuses change. Grantr consumes the IRS's Publication 78 and BMF data files on a daily basis to process over two million records in order to stay current. I built Grantr from scratch with a design provided by a graphic designer.
